This repository contains scripts and notebooks for the [EarthDaily Analytics Hackathon](https://pages.earthdaily.com/hackathon) at [BiDS 2023](https://www.bigdatafromspace2023.org/). There is material for people who want to focus on data access and data visualisation under the `STAC` category, and material for people who want to explore machine learning (`ML`). Of course you can combine these, for example by first training a model and then processing imagery generated via STAC to build cool analytics applications!

# Setup
To run the notebooks without leaving Github or setting up a python environment you can use a [codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces). This approach will be demonstrated. Note however that codespaces do not provide a GPU (to the best of our knowledge)

In [Goolge Colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/), [AWS Sagemaker Studio Lab](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/) or on [lightning.ai](https://lightning.ai/) you just need to git clone this repository and then `pip install -r requirements.txt`
